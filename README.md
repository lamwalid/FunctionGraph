# The SimpleGrapher 
program can draw graphs of functions input by the user.  The user enters the definition of the function in a text input box.  When the user presses return or clicks the "Enter" button,
     the function is graphed.  (Unless the definition contains an error. In that case, an error message is displayed.)
     The graph is drawn on a canvas which represents the region of the (x,y)-plane given by  -5 <= x <= 5  and  -5 <= y <= 5.  Any part of
     the graph that lies outside this region is not shown.  The graph  is drawn by plotting 301 points and joining them with lines.  This
     does not handle discontinuous functions properly.
